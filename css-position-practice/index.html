    <body>
        <div class="static">
            <h1>Static</h1>
            <b>staticis</b> the default value. An element with the <i>position </i> static; is not positioned in any special way. A static element is said to be NOT postioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned

        </div>

        <div class="relative1">

            <h1>Relative</h1>

            Setting the <i>top, bottom, left, and right</i> properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
        </div>

        <div class="relative2">
            <h1>Relative Using Left Property </h1>
            Setting the <i>top, bottom, left, and right</i> properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

        </div>

        <div class="fixed">
            A fixed element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place EVEN if the page is scrolled. As with relative, the top, right, bottom, and left properties are used.
            <h1>fixed</h1>
            A fixed element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place EVEN if the page is scrolled. As with relative, the top, right, bottom, and left properties are used.
        </div>

        <div class="absolute">
            absolute is the trickiest position value. Absolute behaves like <i>fixed</i> except <i>relative</i> to the nearest positioned ancestor instead of the relative viewport. If an absolutely positioned element has no positoned ancestors, it uses the document body, and stil moves along with page scrolling. Remember a "positoned" element is one whose positon is anything but static.
            <h1>absolute</h1>
            This element is absolutley-positioned. It's positioned relative to its par
        </div>    
         <div class="relative3"> 
            <h1>relative</h1>
            This element is relatively-positioned. If this element was position: static; its absolutely-positioned child would escape and would be positioned relative to the document body.
