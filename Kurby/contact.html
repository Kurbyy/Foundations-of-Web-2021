            <h1>
                Case
            </h1>

            <p>Think of the case as the container that holds all the parts.Cases come in many shapes and sizes. Different colors and different materials like aluminum, acrlyic, abs plastic and many more! </p>

            <h1>Switches</h1>

            <p>Probably one of the most important parts of a keyboard. Switches are made up of 4 parts. Top housing, Stem, Spring, and bottom housing. Each part has a important part in how the switch will sound and feel when typing. </p>

            <h1>PCB</h1>

            <p>The PCB is what makes the keyboard work with your computer. You install your switches into the pcb by either using a solder pcb or a hotswap pcb, which is better if you prefer to test new switches out often with out having to desolder them everytime.</p>

            <h1>Plate</h1>

            <p>Essentially a plate holds your switches in place but can also effect the sound of the board. Plate mostly consist of aluminum, brass, POM, Fr4, and Polycarbonate. You can also build a board without a plate but only if your are soldering the swicthes.</p>

            <h1>Keycaps</h1>

            <p>Everyones favorite part and most customizable! Just like many of the other parts these come in many materials and profiles. There are plenty of colors and themes to choose from.</p>
